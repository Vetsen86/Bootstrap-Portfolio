                <p>Hi, my name is Jon Erik Beckstrand, though I go by my middle name, Erik. I'm 31 years old, although I
                    know that I look about 20, at the most. I was born in Salt Lake City, and have been here my whole
                    life. My dream, however, is to move somewhere else in the country to start, and then possibly move
                    out of the country. At the very least I'd like to travel to as many countries as I possibly can.</p>
                    <br>


                    <p>My interests and hobbies are all pretty nerdy. I guess you could say I'm a stereotypical nerd. Video
                    games are by far my favorite, and I spend most of my free time and extra cash on them. I also love
                    movies, especially Quentin Tarantino. I'm a big animal lover and I really wish I had the extra cash
                    for a pet, but they're so darn expensive! I looooooooove food, especially anything Asian.</p>
                    <br>


                    <p>As far as coding goes, I'm not afraid to admit that I'm a beginner. I had some self-taught
                    experience prior to entering the bootcamp, but nothing to write home about. I am finding that little
                    bit of knowledge to be invaluable, however. It would certainly be much harder to keep up without it.
                    I'm hoping to secure a job as a web developer once I graduate, mostly because I enjoy coding but
                    also because it pays quite well!</p>
